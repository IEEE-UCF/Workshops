This Repository serves as documentation for all previous IEEE UCF workshops technically

Each workshop folder should include:\n
  \t A BOM to show whats needed per kit and where we got the materials from
  \n\t The step by step to walk the user through each workshop
  \n\t All necessary files needed to run any code, or CAD files to replicate encasements
  
Thank you for checking us out! Let us know if you have any questions
